            The sky is a vast and fascinating topic! It’s essentially the atmosphere and outer space as seen from Earth. During the day, it appears blue due to the scattering of sunlight by air molecules—a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. At sunrise and sunset, the sky can turn stunning shades of red, orange, and pink because the sunlight has to pass through more of the atmosphere, scattering shorter blue wavelengths and leaving the longer red wavelengths.</p>
